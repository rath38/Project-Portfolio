                                    <p>Leftover Delights is a food donation system in which restaurants or grocery stores can donate leftover foods to food banks and homeless shelters. The end goal was to create a streamlined and intuitive interface to allow donors to make posts for food donations and food deliveries using google maps integration to give directions to volunteers for donor food pick up, and a system in which recipients can confirm food deliveries have reached their location and send out confirmation text messages to the donors.</p>

                                     <p>The front end code for the project was made using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript using an MVC framework. Passport.JS was used for user authentication, and Express was used as our server framework for the project. MySQL was used as our database and Sequelize was used as our ORM framework to query and manipulate data within our database. Google map API was used to map out locations of shelters and also give directions to volunteers. The site also had the twilio API give text message notifications to donors and volunteers. </p>

                                    <p>The Cryptocurrency Tracker is a web application made to track cryptocurrency. The goal was to create a streamlined and easy to use interface to allow users to find and track their favorite coins to find information such as daily, weekly, and monthly prices along with other information, all on easy to read tables.There were many problems we had to overcome but the end goal was reached with most of the features working from our original plan.</p>
                                    <p>The various technologies that we used to build our project were MySQL, Sequelize, User Authentication, Express, The MVC framework, Handlebars, Bootstrap, Web API's, and various others. Handlebars.JS was used as our main HTML templating engine using dynamically created HTML to be served from our server as a web page. Passport.JS was used for user authentication, and Express was used as our server framework for the project.MySQL was used as our database and Sequelize was used as our ORM framework to query and manipulate data within our database. </p>

                                    <p>The Kickass Storefront is portal designed to allow you view the products of various stores. The end goal was to create a user friendly and easy way for users to view and buy products from multiple stores within a single web page.The project was built using HTML, Bootstrap, jQuery, And Walmart and Best Buy Web API's. The end goal for the project was never met because many compromises had to be made.</p>
                                     <p>The end product allowed the user to view the products and the information about the products from only two stores, less than our intended goal of a minimum of five different stores, due to problems with the API’s having inconsistent formats. In the end we reduced the remaining stores to only Walmart and Best Buy. Also the ability to buy products from within the portal was dropped during the development process due to a mixture of our lack of experience and the feasibility within the short amount time we were provided.</p>
                                    <p>The project was a great learning experience providing real world insight on problems that can occur during development in a team based project, teaching us how to overcome the problems and get the project finished. </p>
